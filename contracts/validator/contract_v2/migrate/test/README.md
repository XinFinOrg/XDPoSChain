# Project Setup and Testing

This repository contains scripts for testing various workflows in a development environment. The steps below will guide you through setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running tests.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js version 20 installed.
- **Yarn**: Yarn is used for managing dependencies.

## Environment Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project directory. This file will contain the following environment variables:

   ```env
   RPC_URL=<Your Devnet RPC URL>
   M1_PRIVETE_KEY=<Masternode 1 Private Key>
   M2_PRIVETE_KEY=<Masternode 2 Private Key>
   M3_PRIVETE_KEY=<Masternode 3 Private Key>
   M4_PRIVETE_KEY=<Masternode 4 Private Key>
   M5_PRIVETE_KEY=<Masternode 5 Private Key>
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values.

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies** by running the following command:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

   This will install all the required packages for the project.

## Running Tests

### Test Main Workflow

To test the main workflow, execute the following command:

```bash
node scripts/testMainWorkFlow.js
```

### Test KYC Invalid Flow

To test the KYC invalid flow, execute the following command:

```bash
node scripts/testKycInvalidFlow.js
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly configured with the required RPC URL and masternode private keys before running the tests.
- If any issues arise during the testing process, double-check the environment variables and dependency installation.
